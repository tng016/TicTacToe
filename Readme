===== Tic Tac Toe ======

Created: September 2016

Status: Complete with bugs

I just did this simple tic tac toe game as a basic warmup into board games with 2D arrays. After this I did a Battleship game (see repository)

=== Problems to resolve: ===

If a user puts in a float/char into the input, how to reject the input and ask for another input?
Currently the program crashes when you input a non integer input
-> Use exception handling but I'm too lazy to refactor it
